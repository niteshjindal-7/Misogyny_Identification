# Misogyny_Identification
It contains my analysis and code pertaining to MAMI SemEval Task 5 Dataset. 
I worked on SemEval dataset which can be requested from the below link: https://github.com/MIND-Lab/SemEval2022-Task-5-Multimedia-Automatic-Misogyny-Identification-MAMI-/

The dataset has approx 10000 images and a separate text files corresponding to those images. 

In the code files, 14_Model_DistilBERT_CLIP_VAE_BLIP_NN_VOWELPERTURB_3.ipynb notebook contains the final development code for our propopsed approach. 

The Repository also has all the result files (xlsx.) classification reports obtained through several individual experiments.
